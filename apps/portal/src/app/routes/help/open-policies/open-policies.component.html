  <h2 id="open-data-policy">Open Data Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Data provided by NASA and ESA from Earth observing satellites, field
    campaigns, and algorithms shall be fully and openly available to all users
    as soon as the data becomes available. There should be no period of
    exclusive access to the data. This follows the NASA Data and Information
    Policy (<a
      href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-information-policy/"
      >https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-information-policy/</a
    >) and the ESA Open Access Policy (<a
      href="http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Digital_Agenda/ESA_affirms_Open_Access_policy_for_images_videos_and_data"
      >http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Digital_Agenda/ESA_affirms_Open_Access_policy_for_images_videos_and_data</a
    >).
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, any data shared to the MAAP data store (MDS) by users shall be
    fully and openly available to all users as soon as the data becomes
    available.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information see Addendum #2 (MAAP Data Access Policy) and the End
    User License Agreement.
  </p>

  <h2 id="open-source-code-policy">Open Source Code Policy</h2>

  <p>
    All software developed for the MAAP platform implementation shall be made
    available to the public as Open Source Software (OSS) via use of a
    permissive license. This includes software developed to produce data
    products along with any software created to aid in discovering, accessing,
    analyzing, visualizing, and transforming data. OSS is defined as software
    that can be accessed, used, modified, and shared by anyone. OSS is often
    distributed under licenses that comply with the definition of “Open Source”
    provided by the Open Source Initiative (<a href="https://opensource.org/osd"
      >https://opensource.org/osd</a
    >) or meet the definition of “Free Software” provided by the Free Software
    Foundation (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"
      >https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a
    >). This policy also requires that all developed code be delivered to a
    publicly accessible repository hosting service, such as Github, that is
    widely recognized by a large, active OSS community and used by developers of
    Earth science data and tools. This also allows adherence to the NASA ESDS
    Open Source Policy (<a
      href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-science-data-systems-program/policies/esds-open-source-policy"
      >https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-science-data-systems-program/policies/esds-open-source-policy</a
    >).
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, any algorithms shared to the MAAP data store by users shall be
    fully and openly available to all users as soon as the algorithm becomes
    available. Algorithms retained within a private collaboration space will not
    be subject to the open source code policy unless it is shared to the MAAP by
    the user.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <h3>NASA</h3>

  <p>
    NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program requires that all software
    developed through research and technology awards or in-house, government
    funded development is to be made available to the public as Open Source
    Software (OSS). This includes all software developed with ESDS funding used
    in the production of data products, as well as software developed to
    discover, access, analyze, visualize, and transform NASA data. Please
    see&nbsp;<a
      href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-science-datasystems-program/policies/esds-open-source-policy"
      >https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-science-datasystems-program/policies/esds-open-source-policy</a
    >&nbsp;for details on the ESDS Program’s OSS policy, including preferred
    licenses.
  </p>

  <h3>ESA</h3>

  <p>
    In 2011 ESA has defined and adopted and Open Source Code Policy (OSS) that
    allows the use of Open Source software for ESA space programmes. Together
    with the policy a set of ESA OSS licenses has been defined, but they are
    valid only for the territory of the ESA member states. Therefore it has been
    decided to release the MAAP pilot under the Apache 2 license that has no
    territorial validity restrictions. The license to be used for the full MAAP
    is not defined yet.
  </p>

  <h2>MAAP Data Access Policy</h2>

  <h3><strong>MAAP Data and Information Policy</strong></h3>

  <p>
    All data and algorithms made available in the MAAP shall conform to NASA’s
    Data and Information policy<sup
      ><a
        href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-science-data-systems-program/policies/data-information-policy"
        >[1]</a
      ></sup
    >and ESA’s Revised Earth Observation Data Policy<sup
      ><a
        href="https://earth.esa.int/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=296006&amp;name=DLFE-3602.pdf"
        >[2]</a
      ></sup
    >. This includes data and algorithms from NASA, ESA and other data
    providers. The MAAP promotes the full and open sharing of all data with the
    research and applications communities, private industry, academia, and the
    general public. The greater the availability of the data, the more quickly
    and effectively the user communities can utilize the information to address
    basic Earth science questions and provide the basis for developing
    innovative practical applications to benefit the general public. For data
    access, the MAAP’s policy includes the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The MAAP commits to the full and open sharing of Earth science data
      obtained from Earth observing satellites, sub-orbital platforms and field
      campaigns with all users as soon as such data become available.
    </li>
    <li>
      There will be no period of exclusive access to MAAP Earth science data.
      Following a post-launch checkout period, all science data will be made
      available to the user community. Any variation in access will result
      solely from user capability, equipment, and connectivity.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MAAP will make available all standard products along with the source
      code for algorithm software, coefficients, and ancillary data used to
      generate these products.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MAAP will enforce a principle of non-discriminatory data access so
      that all users will be treated equally.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MAAP will engage in ongoing partnerships with other institutions to
      increase the effectiveness of the MAAP. This interagency cooperation shall
      include: sharing of data from satellites and other sources, mutual
      validation and calibration data, and consolidation of duplicative
      capabilities and functions.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MAAP will negotiate and implement arrangements with its international
      partners, with an emphasis on meeting the data acquisition, distribution,
      and archival needs of the MAAP.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Data Rights</strong></h3>

  <p>
    Data exchanged between NASA and ESA will be exchanged without restriction as
    to its disclosure, use, or duplication except as otherwise provided. The
    exchanged data will be subject to NASA’s data rights clause<sup
      ><a
        href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-information-policy/data-rights-related-issues"
        >[3]</a
      ></sup
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    To facilitate open collaboration between NASA and ESA, a list of all data to
    be included in the MAAP will be shared. Each agency will review the
    identified datasets to identify any potential data access concerns and will
    approve the list once all concerns have been addressed. Each agency will
    agree to a method for sharing data across the infrastructures and will
    openly communicate when data has been added to the respective
    infrastructures. Attribution and provenance of a data product will be
    clearly defined in the appropriate metadata and other relevant
    documentation.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, data and algorithms developed by MAAP users shall be shared to
    the MAAP without restriction as to its disclosure, use, or duplication
    except as otherwise provided. Following a reasonable verification period,
    all data and algorithms generated by MAAP users will be made available to
    the user community. Algorithms and other relevant software created by users
    will also be subject to the open source process.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p><strong>Non-discriminatory Data Access</strong></p>

  <p>
    In accordance with NASA’s and ESA’s data policies, data access within the
    MAAP shall be consistent and non-discriminatory so that all users of the
    MAAP are treated equally. Specific implementation details concerning data
    access will be described in the MAAP interoperability document.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, data access to user provided data shall also be consistent and
    non-discriminatory so that all users of the MAAP are treated equally. MAAP
    users should understand that the sharing of data and algorithms is expected
    within the platform. Therefore, restricted or limited access data and
    proprietary software should be avoided by users. More specific details on
    the required timeframe for sharing data and algorithms will be explained in
    the MAAP governance document and the MAAP user agreement policy (TBD**).
