User data ingestion can be done with Eclipse Che or Copa

== Ingestion from Eclipse Che using a Jupyter Notebook

Open your workspace in Eclipse Che and clone the Demo-scripts repository

* _git clone https://repo.uat.maap-project.org/esa-common/demo-scripts.git_

Run the next commands to install necessary libraries

* _conda install --freeze-installed rasterio_
* _conda install --freeze-installed ipywidgets_
* _jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager_

Refresh your web page open the notebook */demo-scripts/edav/user-data-ingest-from-module.ipynb*

As described in the screen below, you can ingest a local file or a remote file already stored on s3 storage

Execute the notebook and fill the parameters of your ingestion (use case example - ingestion from local file)

== Ingestion from COPA

Open Copa by clicking on Orchestrator in the tools menu

Check this help page to understand how to use copa if necessary : *COPA > Use COPA interface*

Create your workflow and use the algorithm _ingest-user-data-in-edav_ to ingest data in the MAAP front-end.

WARNING: Don't forget to fill the configuration parameters.

Then after the execution of you workflow you can also visualize your file in the MAAP front-end from the User-data catalog
