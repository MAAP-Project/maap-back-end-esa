It's possible to download a subset data from Eclipse Che in a jupyter notebook and from Copa.

== Download from Eclipse Che

* Follow the next procedure to create your workspace : *Eclipse CHE > Create New Workspace > Manage Jupyter workspace*
* Open your workspace in Eclipse Che and clone the Demo-scripts repository : _git clone https://repo.uat.maap-project.org/esa-common/demo-scripts.git_
* Open the notebook */demo-scripts/edav/edav_make_subset_from_catalog_data.ipynb*

=== Explore Part

Go on the MAAP front-end choose your catalog and dataset and add it on maap,
if the dataset is *ESACCI_Biomass_L4_AGB* you can directly select your subset because it's global data, otherwise you have firstly to zoom to dataset are. Then, follow the next procedure :

image::{imagesprefix}/image1.png[]

image::{imagesprefix}/image2.png[]

image::{imagesprefix}/image3.png[]

== Go back to Eclipse Che workspace, use Notebook

After that paste the url in the notebook *edav_make_subset_from_catalog_data.ipynb* in the data variable data :

image::{imagesprefix}/image4.png[]

Then you can run the next cells to download and visualize you subset data

== Download from COPA

If you want to use copa you have to make a workflow with also an algorithm wich will transfer you data on s3 storage to be able to retrieve it.

Follow the procedue described in the next help page : *COPA > Use COPA interface*
