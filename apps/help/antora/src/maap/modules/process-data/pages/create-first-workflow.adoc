== Introduction

With COPA you can create Workflows which are composed of a series of processes that may occur sequentially, in parallel, with specified dependencies to enable one step to be executed after another, or a mixture of both.

== Initial procedure

.Pre-requisites :
log in to the MAAP platform with your credentials

. Once logged, click on Tools in the menu, then click on Orchestrator. A new window is opened.
+
To create a workflow, click on create a new diagram at the bottom middle of the page
+
*_Use case_* : I want to download subset data from edav front-end and upload this data to s3
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image1.png[]
+
. To see available algorithms you can click on the search bar Fin and Algorithm and then on the magnifying glass
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image2.png[]
+
. Then if you click on start
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image3.png[]

. Click on append task icon
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image4.png[]
+
Then the block will appear
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image5.png[]
+
. To add an algorithm in the task search your algorithm, click in the task block and then on the algorithm
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image6.png[]
+
Then your algorithm will be displayed in the block
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image7.png[]
+
. To add onother algorithm depending on your workflow use case tou can click on the task block and add another one with another algorithm with the same process *(NB: the name of the algorithm to transfer data on s3 is now "transfer-from-copa-s3" and not s3-transfer as you can see on the screens below)*.
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image8.png[]

. Then at the end of your workflow add click on the Append EndEvent block
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image9.png[]

. Once it’s done fill the name of the worflow which must be in lowercase without special caracters and click on save to save the workflow.
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image10.png[]

. Then this page will appears, click on validate Run Workflow
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image11.png[]

. Algorithms configuration

.. Subset-data configuration :
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image12.png[]
+
.. Go on the MAAP front-end select your subset on dataset and paste Url in the subsetData parameter, then set the name of your subset in the filename parameter
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image13.png[]
+
.. S3-transfer configuration :
+
image::{imagesprefix}/image14.png[]
+
*_Focus on value_* : *maap-scientific-data/shared/TOBE_COMPLETED*
+
If you want to save your data on s3 complete the s3 destination parameter :
+
_Example : maap-scientific-data/shared/myname/subsetdata_
+
TIP: if you don’t complete the pathor if you replace the beginning of the path _“maap-scientific-data/shared”_ you will not be able to download data. Your path must start with _maap-scientific-data/shared/_.
+
. Finally click on Valide and Run to run the workflow
+

. If you want to download your data you can use the maap-s3 script In jupyter or on your laptop
