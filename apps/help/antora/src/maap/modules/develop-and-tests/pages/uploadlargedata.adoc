= Upload Large Data in Jupyter
:author: Camille Clavi√©

By default the Jupyter provide a limit of 250Mb for uploading data in the Jupyter.

This limitation cannot be changed because, the browser has it's own limitation and data manipulated by users are more and more bigger.

So the MAAP provide a script allowing the user, using a cloud storage to store BIG data. The process is divided in 3 steps:

. Upload the data from laptop to Maap S3
. Login and open the workspace
. Download the data from S3
