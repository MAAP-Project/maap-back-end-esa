== Installing custom libraries

The MAAP platform provide a Jupyter environment integrated in the Eclipse che and a Theia environment which is a visual studio code editor.

The platform allows developers to install their own librairies. But in order to have the persistence, developers must be carefully during the creation of the workspace.

In order to install librairies you want, please follow carefully the documentation below:

. Login in the Maap platform using the credentials provided by the ESA Team.
. Create a Jupyter workspace by clicking on Jupyter under Get started
. Wait until the workspace is initiated
. Once you have a Jupyter workspace, click on the terminal
. Once the conda environement is initiated, it is closed automatically
. Please, click once again on the Terminal. Wait 3 seconds. Then you will see a message workspace is ready
. Now you can install additionnal conda or python package



== Saving customisation

It is possibile to save the current state of the conda environment so that every additional package will still be available when restarting or creating a new workspace.

In a Terminal, enter the following command lines :

[source,]
--
cd
tar zcf my-private-bucket/conda.tar.gz .conda .bash_profile .condarc
--

To use the MAAP default conda environment instead of a customised one, remove (or rename) the existing back-up

[source,]
--
cd
rm my-private-bucket/conda.tar.gz
--
